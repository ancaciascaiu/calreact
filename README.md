This is a Rails app with React front-end that helps post appointments in a calendar and lists all appointments on-the-fly.
Postgres database to be able to deploy on Heroku.
Uses Moment.js module for formatting.
In the future I'd like to add form validations, show past and future appointments separately and edit/delete listed appointments.
